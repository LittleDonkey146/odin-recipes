        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>For people like me, who can't make good pancakes, this recipe is perfect. 
            Everything is cooked in the oven in one single skillet, giving the 
            plus of easy clean up. Serve with maple syrup.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>¾ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>¾ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh strawberries</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, sugar, salt, 
                and flour into a blender. Pulse until no dry lumps 
                remain in the batter. Melt the butter in an 8-inch, 
                cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the 
                batter, and drop in the strawberries.</li>
            <li>Place the skillet into the oven, and bake until 
                puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from 
                the oven and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
